      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>This website is made for every member of our local community that enjoys playing shuffleboard and partaking in tapioca pudding. To elaborate, The Davenport Chamber of Commerce serves people interested in networking and investigating the plethora of local businesses.</p>
      <p>...in theory. Mostly this site will serve the Chamber of Commerce members and whatever sad souls they convince to click on a link.</p>
